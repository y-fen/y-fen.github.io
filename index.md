## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Nanovision Technology at Shizuoka University in Hamamatsu, Japan. My research focuses on **biomedical imaging** and **high dynamic range (HDR) imaging** using **multi-tap CMOS image sensors**.

## Research Interests

- **CMOS Image Sensors:** Sensor design and characterization, imaging system integration, image signal processing  
- **Biomedical Imaging:** Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, motion artifact mitigation, ambient light bias mitigation  
- **HDR Imaging:** Charge-splitting, LED flicker mitigation (LFM), motion artifact mitigation

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** Our confernce paper on ambient-light-robust SFDI was accepted to *ECOB 2025*.  
- **[Jun. 2025]** Our confernce paper on an HDR imaging system for biomedical applications was accepted to *IISW 2025*.
