I am a Ph.D. candidate (expected graduation: Sep. 2026) at [Shizuoka University](https://www.shizuoka.ac.jp/english/) in Hamamatsu, Japan, supervised by [Prof. Keiichiro Kagawa](https://idl.rie.shizuoka.ac.jp/~kagawa/). My research focuses on **biomedical imaging** and **high dynamic range (HDR) imaging** using **multi-tap CMOS image sensors**.

## 📸 Research Interests

- **CMOS Image Sensors:** Sensor design and characterization, imaging system integration, image signal processing  
- **Biomedical Imaging:** Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, motion artifact mitigation, ambient light bias mitigation  
- **HDR Imaging:** Charge-splitting, LED flicker mitigation (LFM), motion artifact mitigation

## 🚀 News
- **[Nov. 2025]** Our selected paper on charge-splitting HDR imaging has been published in the *IISW 2025* special issue of Sensors.
